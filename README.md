## About This Project

This project is part of my learning process for Laravel. It aims to develop a parking management system using Laravel 10 for the backend API. I'm exploring various aspects of Laravel development, including API creation, database integration, authentication, and frontend integration with Vue.js 3. Throughout this project, I'll be documenting my learning journey and sharing insights gained along the way.
